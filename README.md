# StickyComments

_A tool to track and manage code comments across the codebase._

---

StickyComments is an early-stage project focused on helping developers track and manage code comments across a codebase. The goal is to make comments easier to find, manage, and keep them useful, especially as code evolves over time.

## What is StickyComments?

StickyComments aims to give comments a useful structure in the workflow, with the least need of extra steps, helping to maintain healthy codebase comments, providing a solution to common comments tracking and comments-related technical debt pains.

## Project Status

StickyComments is currently in initial development stages, and solutions exploring.

## Initial Focus

- Scanning for comments and capturing core metadata.
- Automatically detecting key tags (e.g., TODO, FIXME).
- Storing comments and metadata in a local database.
- Searching and filtering comments across a project.
- Providing core inline functionalities.
- Exploring further solutions.

## Possible Additions / Ideas Under Consideration

- Comment notifications when code changes occur.
- User-defined tags and flags for custom workflows.
- More advanced tagging and style enforcement.
- Linking comments to git commit history.
- Dedicated UI components for IDE/editor integration.
- Tracking comment states (in progress, done, etc.).
- Templates and shortcuts for common comment styles.
- Analytics for comment usage and updates.
- AI integration for clarity or review.
- Private or team-only comments.
- Threaded discussions directly on comments.
- Linting and onboarding features for new users.

Many ideas are experimental and subject to further evaluation as development continues.
